# `dwolla-sdk-clojure` 

A simple Clojure library for the Dwolla API

## Usage

The main api functionality is provided by the
`dwolla-sdk-clojure.core` namespace.

Require it in the REPL:

```clojure
(require '[dwolla-sdk-clojure.core :as dwolla])
```

Require it in your application:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [dwolla-sdk-clojure.core :as dwolla]))
```

The client functions off a simple interface that only requires the desired endpoint and request.

Below is an example send request (post):

```clojure
(dwolla/api :send {:oauth_token "" :pin "" :destinationId "" :amount ""})
```

Here is a simple account info request (get):

```clojure
(dwolla/api :account_info "your oauth token")
```

Multi parameter get requests have their parameters passed in via a vector:

```clojure
(dwolla/api :nearby ["client_id" "client_secret" "lat" "long"])
```

All results are returned as simple Clojure maps:

```clojure
{:Response nil, :Message "Invalid access token.", :Success false, :Request-time 321 :Status 200}
```
